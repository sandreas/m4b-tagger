# m4b-tagger
Cross Plattform GUI Tool to tag, split, join and edit m4b files

## NOTICE
Unfortunately this project still is an empty skeleton without any release. The good news: There is an command line alternative that pretty much does everything i've been originally planning for this project:

If you prefer a GUI, you could also use:
